	 			<h2>What is Net Neutrality?</h2>
	 			<p class="bodyP">
					Net Neutrality is the principle that Internet Service Providers(ISP's) and governments should treat all data on the Internet equally, not discriminating or charging differentially by user, content, site, platform, application, type of attached equipment, or mode of communication. 
				</p>
				<h2>What does it mean for me?</h2>
				<p class="bodyP">
					The internet currently operates on a principal called Open Internet. The Open Internet is the idea that the full resources of the internet and means to use all that information are easily available to everyone. Without Net Neutrality, ISP’s could charge companies to put them in a fast lane or grant them faster access to their website/web services. Smaller companies wouldn’t be able to pay the premium and it would increase the barrier of entry for newer companies. Not only would big businesses have an even greater advantage over small companies, overtime this increased barrier of entry would kill small business creation and negatively affect the content you as a consumer can access on the Internet. Furthermore, ISP’s would be able to charge you a “premium” fee to allow you to access all content at the same speed you were getting with larger companies. The end result is a lack of competitive services, a higher internet bill, and slowed job creation in general.
				</p>
				<h2>What about my Privacy?</h2>
				<p class="bodyP">
					ISP’s can currently view all the data you use through a technique called deep packet inspection. Deep Packet Inspection allows ISP’s to see exactly what kind of data you are using from, including the type of content and the source, and subsequently allows them to block data from that source. This technique is frequently used by countries that practice internet censorship (e.g. China), to stop users from reaching Information. With deep packet inspection, ISP’s can block content from any source they choose to, including service competitors and bandwidth heavy applications. 
				</p>
				<h2>Isn't Capitalism the Solution?</h2>
				<p class="bodyP">
					While the principles of capitalism generally work in creating competition and increasing the quality of service, it doesn’t apply to ISP’s. ISP’s are essentially an oligopoly. An oligopoly is a market form in which a market or industry is dominated by a small number of sellers due to a high barrier of entry. New ISP’s have to pay premiums to use the infrastructure the cities have built that range within the millions. Furthermore, local municipalities have cut deals with current ISP’s that allow free services for them in exchange for lenient pricing and regulations. Have you ever wondered why you only have access to one ISP in your area? ISP’s have also made agreements with each other to create service areas. These types of collusion between ISP’s create artificial scarcity and drive up prices while providing no incentives to upgrade their services. However, when completion is introduced ISP’s react quickly. For example, the introduction of Google Fiber in Kansas City led to ISP’s in the areas slashing costs and nearly quadrupling the internet speed while keeping the connection more stable. So in short, the principles of capitalism work, however due to the aforementioned agreements and the high barrier of entry, it isn’t a huge force in the current market.

	 			<h2>Why haven't I seen this on the News?</h2>
	 			<p class="bodyP">
	 				The Pew Research Center finds that the “coverage of Net Neutrality has been all but absent from network and cable news coverage”. The main reason behind this is that all major news networks are owned by huge telecommunication companies, for example NBC and NBC Universal are owned by Comcast. By and large the issue is kept out of the news to try and keep people uninformed about potentially huge changes in the way the internet is managed. Newspapers only fair a little better, out of all major U.S newspapers, only six consistently put out content related to the issue of Net Neutrality, and only three call out politicians taking huge donations from the telecommunication companies.
